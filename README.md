Mongodb
=======

## Features

## Immediate Roadmap

  * Bang and non-bang `Mongo` functions
  * Documentation
  * Move low-level API to `Connection` and have `Mongo` be the next-gen driver API
    - Split database and collection actions?
  * Move BSON encoding to client process
    - Make sure requests don't go over the 16mb limit
  * Replica sets
    - Block in client (and timeout) when waiting for new primary selection
  * New 2.6 write queries and bulk writes
  * Cursors
  * Reconnect backoffs with https://github.com/ferd/backoff
  * Lazy connect

## Tentative Roadmap

  * SSL
  * Use meta-driver test suite
  * Smarter pooling
    - A single connection can serve multiple requests concurrently so traditional pooling (like poolboy) a where single process takes exclusive access of a connection may not fit. Furthermore it is not ideal that long running cursors reserves a connection from the pool for the cursor's full duration. Pooling libraries such as sbroker allows a connection to serve multiple requests, ideally it would be combined with a dispatcher that selects an appropriate connection based on its internal queue.
  * Server selection / Read preference

## Usage


### Connection Pools

```elixir
defmodule MongoPool do
  use Mongo.Pool, name: __MODULE__, adapter: Mongo.Pool.Poolboy
end

# Starts the pool named MongoPool
{:ok, _} = MongoPool.start_link(database: "test")

# Gets an enumerable cursor for the results
cursor = Mongo.find(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{})

Enum.to_list(cursor)
|> IO.inspect
```

### APIs
```elixir
Mongo.find(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{}, limit: 20)
Mongo.find(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => %{"$gt" => 0}}, limit: 20, sort: %{"field" => 1})

Mongo.insert_one(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => 10})

Mongo.insert_many(MongoPool, "test-collection", [%{"field" => 10}, %{"field" => 20}])

Mongo.delete_one(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => 10})

Mongo.delete_many(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => 10})
```

### Pool Transactions
```elixir
# Gets a pool process (conn) to run queries on
MongoPool.transaction(fn (conn) ->
  # Removes 1 result using the query
  Mongo.Connection.remove(conn, "test-collection", %{"field" => 1})

  # Removes all results using the query
  Mongo.Connection.remove(conn, "test-collection", %{"field" => 1, "otherfield" => 1}, multi: true)
end)
```
