[![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/ericmj/mongodb.svg)](http://inch-ci.org/github/ericmj/mongodb)

## Features

## Immediate Roadmap

  * Add timeouts for all calls
  * Bang and non-bang `Mongo` functions
  * Move BSON encoding to client process
    - Make sure requests don't go over the 16mb limit
  * Replica sets
    - Block in client (and timeout) when waiting for new primary selection
  * New 2.6 write queries and bulk writes
  * Reconnect backoffs with https://github.com/ferd/backoff
  * Lazy connect
  ? Drop save_* because it was dropped by driver specs

## Tentative Roadmap

  * SSL
  * Use meta-driver test suite
  * Server selection / Read preference

    - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/read-preference

## Usage

### Connection Pools

```elixir
defmodule MongoPool do
  use Mongo.Pool, name: __MODULE__, adapter: Mongo.Pool.Poolboy
end

# Starts the pool named MongoPool
{:ok, _} = MongoPool.start_link(database: "test")

# Gets an enumerable cursor for the results
cursor = Mongo.find(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{})

Enum.to_list(cursor)
|> IO.inspect
```
